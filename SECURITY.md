### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Environment**: Version, OS, configuration details
5. **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if applicable)
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for mitigation

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Every 5 business days until resolution
- **Resolution**: Critical issues within 30 days, others within 90 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Report**: Security issues reported privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop fixes
3. **Coordination**: We coordinate with reporters on disclosure timing
4. **Public Advisory**: After fixes are deployed, we publish security advisories

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
