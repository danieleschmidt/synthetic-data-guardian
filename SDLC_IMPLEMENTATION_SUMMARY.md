## üîÑ Deferred Checkpoints

### CHECKPOINT 5: Monitoring & Observability Setup
**Status**: DEFERRED (Existing Infrastructure)  
**Reason**: Repository already contains comprehensive monitoring setup including:
- Prometheus and Grafana configurations
- Docker Compose observability stack
- OpenTelemetry setup documentation
- Monitoring dashboards and alerts

### CHECKPOINT 7: Metrics & Automation Setup
**Status**: DEFERRED (Time Constraints)  
**Reason**: Core SDLC infrastructure prioritized. Repository contains:
- Basic automation scripts in place
- Package.json scripts for automation
- Makefile with comprehensive targets

### CHECKPOINT 8: Integration & Final Configuration
**Status**: DEFERRED (Permission Limitations)  
**Reason**: Repository settings require administrative access. Documentation provided for manual setup.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Assessment
