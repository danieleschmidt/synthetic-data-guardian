# CI/CD Workflow Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the required GitHub Actions workflows for the Synthetic Data Guardian project. These workflows implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with security, quality, and compliance gates.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  release:
    types: [ published ]

env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18.17.0'
  PYTHON_VERSION: '3.11'
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}

jobs:

  # Deploy to staging
  deploy-staging:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    needs: [build]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:

      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: echo "Deploy to staging environment"

  # Deploy to production
  deploy-production:
    if: github.event_name == 'release'
    needs: [build]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: echo "Deploy to production environment"
```

### 2. Security Scanning Workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

```yaml
name: Security Scanning

          sleep 10
      - name: Run performance tests
        run: npm run test:performance
      - name: Upload performance results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: performance-results

```

## Integration Requirements

### Environment Variables
Configure these secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: Snyk API token for dependency scanning
- `GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY`: GitGuardian API key for secret scanning
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Codecov token for coverage reporting

### Branch Protection Rules
Enable these rules for `main` branch:
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require review from code owners
- Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB

### Required Status Checks
- `security-scan`
- `test (18.x)`
- `build`
- `codecov/patch`
- `codecov/project`

## Deployment Strategy

### Staging Environment
- Triggered on pushes to `develop` branch
- Automated deployment with integration testing
- Manual approval gate for production promotion

### Production Environment
- Triggered on GitHub releases
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback on health check failures
- Manual approval gate with security review

## Monitoring Integration

### Required Metrics
- Build success/failure rates
- Test coverage percentage
- Security vulnerability counts
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery

### Alerting
- Failed builds notify team via Slack
- Security vulnerabilities create GitHub issues
- Performance degradation triggers alerts

## Compliance Requirements

### Audit Trail
- All deployments logged with Git SHA
- Security scan results archived
- Performance metrics tracked over time
- SBOM generated for each release

### Retention Policies
- Build artifacts: 30 days
- Security scan results: 1 year
- Performance metrics: 6 months
- Audit logs: 2 years
