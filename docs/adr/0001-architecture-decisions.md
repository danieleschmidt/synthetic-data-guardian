# ADR-0001: Core Architecture Decisions

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

We need to establish the foundational architecture for the Synthetic Data Guardian platform, including technology stack, data flow patterns, and integration strategies.

## Decision

### 1. Python as Primary Language
**Chosen**: Python 3.9+  
**Alternatives**: Java, Go, Rust  
**Rationale**: 
- Extensive ML/AI ecosystem (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch)
- Strong community support for data science libraries
- Rapid prototyping and development speed
- Excellent integration with existing ML tools

### 2. FastAPI for REST API
**Chosen**: FastAPI  
**Alternatives**: Flask, Django REST Framework  
**Rationale**:
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Built-in type validation and serialization
- High performance with async/await support
- Modern Python features (type hints, dependency injection)

### 3. PostgreSQL + Neo4j Dual Database Strategy
**Chosen**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Neo4j for lineage  
**Alternatives**: Single database (PostgreSQL with graph extensions)  
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL: Mature, ACID compliant, excellent for structured metadata
- Neo4j: Purpose-built for graph queries and lineage tracking
- Best-of-breed approach for different data patterns

### 4. Celery for Asynchronous Processing
**Chosen**: Celery with Redis broker  
**Alternatives**: RQ, Ray, Dask  
**Rationale**:
- Mature task queue with extensive monitoring tools
- Redis provides both broker and result backend
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Rich ecosystem of integrations

### 5. Docker Containerization
**Chosen**: Docker with multi-stage builds  
**Alternatives**: Native packaging, VM-based deployment  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent deployment across environments
- Dependency isolation and reproducibility
- Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud-native deployment patterns

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development with Python's rich ecosystem
- Automatic API documentation and validation
- Scalable processing with task queues
- Flexible deployment with containers
- Purpose-built storage for different data patterns

### Negative
- Complexity of managing multiple databases
- Python performance limitations for CPU-intensive tasks
- Additional operational overhead with microservices
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with graph databases

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use NumPy/Cython for performance-critical operations
- Implement comprehensive database migration strategies
- Provide extensive documentation and training
- Consider Python alternatives for specific bottlenecks

## Implementation Notes

1. Database connections must be properly pooled and monitored
2. Task queue workers should be auto-scaled based on load
3. All services must include health checks and metrics endpoints
4. Graph database schema must be versioned and migration-capable
