# ADR-0003: Checkpointed SDLC Implementation Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Terragon SDLC implementation requires a systematic approach to handle GitHub permissions limitations and ensure reliable progress tracking across multiple development phases.

## Decision
We will implement a checkpointed SDLC strategy that breaks the implementation into discrete, independently committable phases:

1. **Checkpoint 1: Project Foundation & Documentation**
2. **Checkpoint 2: Development Environment & Tooling** 
3. **Checkpoint 3: Testing Infrastructure**
4. **Checkpoint 4: Build & Containerization**
5. **Checkpoint 5: Monitoring & Observability Setup**
6. **Checkpoint 6: Workflow Documentation & Templates**
7. **Checkpoint 7: Metrics & Automation Setup**
8. **Checkpoint 8: Integration & Final Configuration**

Each checkpoint represents a logical grouping of changes that can be safely committed and pushed independently.

## Rationale
- **Permission Management**: GitHub App limitations require careful handling of workflow creation
- **Progress Tracking**: Each checkpoint can be validated independently
- **Error Recovery**: Failed checkpoints can be retried without affecting completed work
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on different checkpoints simultaneously
- **Audit Trail**: Clear documentation of implementation phases for compliance

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Better error handling, clearer progress tracking, improved collaboration
- **Negative**: More complex branching strategy, requires careful coordination between checkpoints
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and automated validation at each checkpoint

## Implementation
Each checkpoint follows this protocol:
1. Create dedicated branch: `terragon/checkpoint-N-description`
2. Implement all checkpoint requirements
3. Commit with descriptive messages
4. Push immediately after completion
5. Validate checkpoint success before proceeding

## Review
This decision will be reviewed after completing all 8 checkpoints to assess effectiveness and identify improvements for future implementations.
