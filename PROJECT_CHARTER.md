# Synthetic Data Guardian - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

Synthetic Data Guardian is an enterprise-grade platform for generating, validating, and managing synthetic data with built-in privacy protection, compliance reporting, and auditable lineage tracking. The project addresses the critical need for privacy-preserving data sharing while maintaining data utility for AI/ML development and testing.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Privacy Regulations**: GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations restrict use of real data
2. **Data Sharing Barriers**: Organizations cannot safely share sensitive data
3. **AI Development Bottlenecks**: Limited access to realistic training data
4. **Compliance Costs**: Manual privacy assessment and reporting processes
5. **Data Quality Issues**: Poor quality synthetic data reduces model performance

### Business Impact

- **Revenue Loss**: Delayed product launches due to data access restrictions
- **Compliance Risk**: Potential fines and legal liability from data misuse
- **Innovation Barriers**: Reduced collaboration and research capabilities
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Manual processes for data anonymization

## Project Vision

**"To democratize access to high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic data that enables innovation while ensuring regulatory compliance and maintaining trust."**
